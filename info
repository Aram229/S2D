  I see that since I have corrected a tape and a ribbon in label printer there are no errors 
  
  error example in: WRP20200525.log 
					WRP20200526.log 
					
					
	There is a service on WNIEWS0114 which books palettes to SAP.
	Every booked palette is logged in log file in c:\SapwrapPL\logs.
	In attached file you can find one of such log files.
	
	
	Almost every day we have 1 or more this kind of errors and it is always the matter of two zeroes.
	You can review log files and find other examples.

	We have investigated it and found that probably  sometimes  a scanner reads a barcode wrongly and a booking program accepts it.
	The problem is that when we scan this label again it shows a correct value in notepad. We can't repeat the misreading even on the same labels.
	I suppose that the barcode on the label (printed with Andrzej's application) is to wide and margins in both sides of the barcode are
	too narrow that in some circumstances (a light, a angle of scanning, a background  ...) can cause this kind of misreading. 
	I think that  Andrzej probably created the barcode so wide because of some reason. Maybe Unilogo had problem with  the smaller barcodes.

	We want to eliminate this kind of errors.
	Our proposition is to create a display which immediately shows the last booked palettes in SAP. An operator will be able to react and create a cancellation of this palette in SAP and book it correctly again. It will also help operators to check if the label itself is correct and sicked to a right palette. (I know that we have labels on the boxes and operators can check it but...)
	Maybe there is some way to solve this problem on the program's code level.

I've just finished reading the request you sent me...I have a question 
as I see in the powerpoint file which include a representation of new future page .....
Should the table in the new site just contain the CAP IMAGE and the other info coming from Blue Cells as shown in PP?
